Name: BlueAir Website

Author: ytxpk

Intro: A single page website for a mock company that sells air. 

Background: A website created to practice HTML, CSS, and JS and learn new frontend skills. Began in July 2021. The first version of the website was adapted from a tutorial by briancodex. I am reworking the structure, content, and style of the website as an original redesign.
