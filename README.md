Name: BlueAir Website

Author: ytxpk

Intro: A single page website for a mock company that sells air. 

Background: A website created to practice HTML, CSS, and JS and learn new frontend skills. Began in July 2021. I focused on UI UX design for this website by adding animations to improve user experience. 

Features: 
 - Dynamic navbar that changes opacity as the user scrolls through the page
 - Underline animations for buttons and links
