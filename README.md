# BlueAir Website - [Link to Website](https://blueair.netlify.app/)
A website created to expand my knowledge and frontend skills. I focused on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. Hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## What I Learned
### 1. UI / UX
 - Animations and transitions to create a smoother experience
   - Optimizing animation speeds
 - Contrast and elevation for better readability
### 2. JS
 - `intersection observer`
   - As user scrolls, opacity of navigation bar changes
 - Document object model and accessing specific elements
 - Creating a dynamic web page

## Features
 - Mobile responsive
 - Collapsed navigation bar on smaller screens
 - Dynamic navbar that changes opacity as the user scrolls through the page
 - Custom animations and transitions
   - Front page image fades in
   - Buttons and links have special underline animation
